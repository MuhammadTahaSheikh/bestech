5. Replace the webhook URL in the code

## Option 3: Use the Backup Method (Works Now)

2. Logs all booking details to the browser console
3. You can check the console to see the details

## To Check Console:
1. Open your website
2. Press F12 (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Book an appointment
5. You'll see all the details logged there

2. Check your browser console (F12 → Console)
3. You'll see all the booking details logged there
4. The email client should also open with pre-filled details
